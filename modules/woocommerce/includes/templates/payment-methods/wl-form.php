 * The Template for E-Wallet payment in Braspag
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/braspag/payment-methods/wl-form.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Woo Checkout Braspag will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. Just like WooCommerce.
